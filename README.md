# 🛡️ Why does my anti virus recognizes it as a malware?
Windows Defender (and other antivirus programs) sometimes flag legitimate programs as viruses - this is called a "false positive." It doesn't necessarily mean that the program you've installed is dangerous, but rather that Windows Defender's automated systems have mistakenly identified it as suspicious.
